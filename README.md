Localizing your game has never been this easy. Localize your game with only a few mouse clicks.

Just open the Smart Localization Window in Window->Smart Localization and start by pressing 
"Create new localization system".
Edit the root language file by adding some keys and base values.

To add a new language to your project, choose a language in the "Add/Update Languages" panel and click "Create".
To edit and translate a language, press the "Translate" button on the language you want to work with in the Created Languages panel.
